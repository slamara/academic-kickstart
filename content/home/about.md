# Biography

# Hallo!

I am a Post-doctoral scientist with broad-ranging expertise in research, quantitative science and applied Mathematics. My academic output was mainly oriented towards modeling and solving complex systems by analysing big databases and implementing adapted programming codes. I am looking now to apply my skills and experience in the field of data science and big data and I am adapting my knowledge every day to solve practical problems in data science (check the section "projects").

In the past, I have worked on huge raw databases as well as on relational ones, and obtained a certification in database development from Microsoft. I am confortable in programming in R, Python and Fortran and I regularly use R and R-supported visualisation techniques and web apps (such as Shiny) for my projects in data science.
